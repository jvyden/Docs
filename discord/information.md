# Welcome to LittleBigRefresh!

LittleBigRefresh is intended to be a chill environment for people to discuss LittleBigPlanet, its community, its servers, or anything else LBP.

This is also the place for discussing the development of Refresh, a custom server for LittleBigPlanet.

## Rules

We try to be as fair as possible with these. If there are things you would like to suggest or criticize, you are welcome to create a GitHub issue on our documentation repo ([here](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Docs/issues/new)) or contact a staff member.

These rules can basically be summarized to "don't be an a-hole" or "use common sense", but as a general rule of thumb you can follow these:

1. Follow Discord's terms of service. These can be found at <https://discord.com/terms>.

2. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.

3. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

4. No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.

5. Please keep criticism constructive. We generally won't take action for this, but it will be noticed if you are consistently negative when discussing topics with other members.

## Enforcement

We generally try to be hands-off when it comes to punishment. In most cases, the offending content will simply be deleted or you will receive a verbal warning.

In more extreme cases, you will be muted for anywhere between an hour and a week. This mostly happens after persisting after being told to stop doing something by a staff member.

More often than not, a compromise by a staff member is given. For example, one may be told to move to a different channel or thread. Not following this advice will almost definitely result in a mute.

If you have proven to consistently be disrespectful to the community, only then will you be banned.

## Appealing

In the case that you've received a punishment (such as a ban or mute), you may feel this decision has been made unfairly.

We currently lack a system for proper appeals as we usually don't have enough problems to warrant one. However, we still recognize the need for one so right now our recommendation for this right now is to contact a staff member directly.

However, try to avoid contacting the staff member that punished you if possible. This can lead to bias in the handling of your case, as the staff member that punished you will generally not have a opinion in your favor.

Generally though, most punishments are given out for a reason. Due to our hands-off nature we tend to focus on general behaviour rather than individual incidents.

For example, if your punishment was delivered as a result of bad behavior over the past month, we won't be accepting appeals regarding behavior over the past day. Some things may be what cause punishments, but more often than not they are not the whole story.
